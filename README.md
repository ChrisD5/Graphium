### In order to get the database/ backend running you need to configure a new user in sql. 
### We have chosen not to use the standard user for security purposes.

### Database: MariaDB    Username: checkin    Password: checkin6

### To build your project, open a terminal window, navigate to the root directory of your project, and run the following command:

```
gradle build
```

### This will build your project and create a jar file in the build/libs directory.

### To run your project, navigate to the build/libs directory and run the following command:

```
java -jar checkin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
### The project should then be running, navigate to https://localhost to access the webpage.
